   | This command creates a new kubernetes pod, named “f5-ctrl” using the Helm chart defined in the tarball (.tgz) file. The deployment can be customised using values from an appropriate YAML configuration file.
   | Observe the deployment within the SSH session running k9s. A CNF is deployed with several Pods. Note the time for all pods to reach the “running” state.
