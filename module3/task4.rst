F5â€™s Cloud-Native Engine uses the Distributed Session State Manager (DSSM) to store state for BIG-IP CNFs. The DSSM can be deployed using a Helm Chart. 
Deploy DSSM HELM Chart: 
helm install f5-dssm f5-dssm/f5-dssm-0.11.0.tgz --values f5-dssm/values-f5-dssm.yaml 
 
DSSM is deployed as a distributed database across 3 pods. Start shell for f5-dssm-db-0 (using K9s, in the same way as done in the previous) 
DSSM uses a Redis database. You can use redis-cli to work with this database directly. For example, enter redis-cli info to get some basic information.
